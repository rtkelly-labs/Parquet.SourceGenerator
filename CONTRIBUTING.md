## Development Workflow

We follow a strict, modern GitHub workflow across our repositories:

1. **Fork or Branch**:
   - Create a feature or bugfix branch using clear naming:
     - `feat/<feature-name>`
     - `fix/<bug-description>`
     - `docs/<doc-update>`
     - `chore/<maintenance-task>`

2. **Linear History & Rebase**:
   - We enforce a strictly linear history on `main`.
   - Before opening a PR or marking it ready for review, rebase your branch on latest `main`:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/main
     ```

3. **Code Quality & Testing**:
   - Ensure your code passes all local linting, type checks, and automated tests.
   - For Python projects:
     ```bash
     uv run ruff check .
     uv run ruff format --check .
     uv run pyright
     uv run pytest
     ```
   - For TypeScript/Node projects:
     ```bash
     pnpm lint
     pnpm typecheck
     pnpm test
     ```

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Fill out the PR template completely with linked issues and verification steps.
   - All pull requests are merged exclusively via **Squash and Merge**.
