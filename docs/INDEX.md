# Parquet.SourceGenerator Documentation Hub

Welcome to the **Parquet.SourceGenerator** documentation repository. This folder contains the architectural specifications, API designs, implementation details, and project roadmap for building a production-grade, high-throughput C# Source Generator for the [Parquet.Net](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet) library.

---

## 📚 Documentation Portal

The documentation is organized into three distinct tiers based on audience and intent:
- **[Guides](#-guides)** — Task-oriented, consumer-facing documentation for adopting and using the generator.
- **[Reference](#-reference)** — Technical specifications, API surface contracts, compiler diagnostics, and compatibility matrices.
- **[Internals & Engineering Spikes](#-internals--engineering-spikes)** — Contributor deep-dives, compiler pipeline architecture, benchmarking machinery, and deterministic quality gates.

     - Producer/consumer/version matrix across Parquet.Net, PyArrow and DuckDB, and the recorded report.
     - Cross-version interoperability between the modern and classic packages.

11. **[17 - Generated Public API Baselines](./17-GENERATED-API-BASELINES.md)**
     - The `.api.txt` signature-only rendering of every golden model's emitted API, and its grammar.
     - Why it borrows the `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` grammar, and the two deliberate deviations.
     - Why golden output is derived rather than checked in, and the sticky base-vs-head PR comment
       (`derived` CI job) that replaced the refresh-and-commit cycle.

12. **[18 - The API Change Contract](./18-API-CHANGE-CONTRACT.md)**
     - The rule: nothing enters a governed surface without a catalogue line *and* a ledger entry.
     - The three surfaces: shipped package and internal seams, gated at build time by `RS0016` and
       `PARQAPI002`; the emitted API, reviewed through the derived-output PR comment
       (`PARQAPI001` retired).
     - Semver buckets, the pre-1.0 stance, the `**Unapproved-by-design:**` escape hatch, and the
       four-step author process.

13. **[19 - Public API Surface & Naming Grammar](./19-PUBLIC-API-SURFACE.md)**
     - The four-axis read grid — source × shape × execution × pushdown — and which cells exist.
     - Eight catalogued surface defects, each checkable against the emitted `*.api.txt` rendering.
     - The options-vs-parameters rule (D1), the naming grammar, and the fate of the flat methods.

14. **[20 - Unified Pushdown & the Generated/Shipped Boundary](./20-UNIFIED-PUSHDOWN-API.md)**
     - One inspectable filter replacing four pushdown mechanisms; capability declared by attribute, not at the call site.
     - What stays generated, what ships, and the measurements that decide it.
     - Its current-release boundary decision is recorded in [31 - Generated/Shipped Boundary Decision](./31-GENERATED-SHIPPED-BOUNDARY-DECISION.md).

15. **[21 - Code Metrics & The Complexity Ratchet](./21-CODE-METRICS.md)**
     - Roslyn metrics for every entity under `src/`, derived on demand, published as a CI artifact and
       diffed against the base on every PR;
       the gate is `CA1502`/`CA1505`/`CA1506`, and why the numbers are no longer checked in.
     - What the Maintainability Index does *not* tell you, and why `CA1502` is calibrated below the
       cited guidance, with the history of its two named exceptions (#263 deleted both).
     - The measured evidence: `CodeEmitter` at 2,536 lines / complexity 144 (a size problem with
       well-decomposed methods), and the former `TargetParser.CollectMembers` at cyclomatic
       complexity 105 — decomposed in #263, worst method now 25.

16. **[22 - Generated Code Metrics](./22-GENERATED-CODE-METRICS.md)**
     - The same mechanism turned on the *emitted* code: a `*.metrics.txt` report per golden model,
       derived in CI; the only gate is that emitted code compiles (`ERRORS=0`).
     - Which metrics carry signal for generated code and which do not — the Maintainability Index
       carries little, with the measurement that says why.
     - `ELOC_PER_MEMBER`, the size-per-capability ratio: 10 executable lines per emitted member for
       flat models, 33 for row-level lists.

17. **[23 - Duplication Measurement](./23-DUPLICATION.md)**
     - Layer 3 of #251: token-level duplication across `src/`, reported per CI run in the
       `derived-outputs` artifact and PR comment rather than checked in.
     - Calibrated against the repo's demonstrated failure: the tool names the historical
       `ResolveSchemaField` copies and the three read paths that all broke on #196 before it was
       adopted.
     - Emitted code is out of scope by design — generated output repeating itself is the design,
       not a defect.

18. **[24 - The Metrics Oracle](./24-METRICS-ORACLE.md)**
     - Nightly `windows-latest` job running Microsoft's own `Metrics.exe` against the layer-1
       numbers from `scripts/CodeMetrics.cs` — the independent check on the bespoke computation.
     - Type-level agreement gated (MI ±2, the rest exact); assembly totals reported but never
       gated, because the two tools differ in enumeration scope before they could differ in
       arithmetic.
     - Disagreement opens a GitHub issue rather than leaving a red schedule: failing nightlies
       get muted; issues get acted on.

19. **[25 - The Call Graph](./25-CALL-GRAPH.md)**
     - The #251 family's structural view: connectivity as a gated artifact — a derived
       method-level edge list diffed on every PR, catalogued cycles, a fan-out ratchet, and a
       layering rule (components must not call the emitter hub) that would have caught the
       `ResolveSchemaField` divergence as it happened.
     - The honest half: what the static approximation cannot see (delegates, virtuals), and
       why the unresolved count is a headline number rather than a footnote.

20. **[26 - Mutation Testing the Behavioural Suite](./26-MUTATION-TESTING.md)**
     - Layer 4 of #251: would a test notice if a line were *wrong*, not just executed? Stryker,
       run nightly. The design is the exclusion — golden-file / API-baseline / metrics / IL-shape
       suites are left out because they kill every mutation trivially and report a flattering lie.
     - Reports through one refreshed PR, never a red build; no threshold until the baseline exists.

21. **[27 - Architectural Peer Study: Protobuf & Serialization Engines](./27-ARCHITECTURAL-PEER-STUDY-PROTOBUF.md)**
     - Comparative analysis of Google.Protobuf, protobuf-net, and Parquet.SourceGenerator.
     - Architectural trade-offs, where PSG leads, peer mechanisms worth stealing (ABI matrix, corpus sweeps, defensive DoS limits), and why runtime engine seams are rejected.

22. **[30 - Schema Descriptor Evaluation](./30-SCHEMA-DESCRIPTOR-EVALUATION.md)**
     - Measured decision on compact generated schema metadata for issue #291.
23. **[28 - Coverage Envelope Map](./28-COVERAGE-MAP.md)**
     - Source-derived accepted property kinds, nesting and nullability shapes, backend evidence, and risk-ranked gaps.
     - Refresh with `dotnet run scripts/CoverageMap.cs -- --update`; CI rejects drift from the parser and generator dials.
24. **[28 - Build Incrementality Spike (#258)](./28-BUILD-INCREMENTALITY-258.md)**
     - CSharpGeneratorDriver throughput and managed allocation measurements for initial, unrelated-file, and per-model edits.
     - Public Roslyn tracked-output evidence, model value-equality proof, and the resolved `WithTrackingName` compatibility limitation.

25. **[36 - Feature Profiles and Per-Type Overrides](./36-FEATURE-PROFILES-SCOPE-225.md)**
     - Scope decision for named profiles and per-type configuration overrides.

26. **[48 - Flat-Read Removal Before 0.1 (#480)](./48-FLAT-READ-REMOVAL-480.md)**
     - Removes the flat `ReadParquet*Async` methods from the modern emitter; the builder is the only
       modern read surface. Supersedes [document 41](./41-FLAT-READ-FREEZE-SCOPE-262.md) (#262).
     - The legacy emitter keeps its flat reads as its declared subset (#246); no `[Obsolete]` release.
     - Measured shrinkage (−66 members, −222 parameter slots) and the flat → builder migration table.

27. **[49 - Legacy Backend Parity (#490)](./49-LEGACY-PARITY-490.md)**
     - Decision: the legacy (net472) backend is to expose the same generated API as modern, with
       differences listed in a shrinking allowlist. This is the target, not current output: the two
       backends still emit different surfaces until #492 to #496 land. Supersedes the #246
       declared-subset policy.
     - Parquet.Net 4.25 evidence, the shared-surface / per-backend column-I/O split, and the
       one-package end state.

28. **[50 - Generated Code Analysis](./50-GENERATED-CODE-ANALYSIS.md)**
     - Every analyzer `src/` runs (NetAnalyzers, Meziantou, Roslynator, code style, metric and
       AOT rules), run over the golden models' emitted source through `analysis/`.
     - Why none of them saw emitted code before: the `src/` scope, `NoWarn` in consumer projects,
       and generated-code classification (two switches undo it).
     - Gate: any finding fails the `generated-analysis` CI job; the baseline is empty and stays so.

29. **[51 - CI Gate Matrix](./51-CI-GATE-MATRIX.md)**
     - Every gate the project relies on: where it runs, whether branch protection reaches it, how it
       can pass vacuously, and what is open. Includes the line-by-line read of the `build` aggregate.
     - Read it before adding, renaming or removing a CI job; a gate outside `build` blocks nothing.

30. **[44 - Roslyn Generator Tooling Evaluation](./44-GENERATOR-TOOLING-EVALUATION.md)**
     - Verdicts on polyfills, dependency bundling, generator test frameworks, syntax builders, and author analyzers against what this repository already does.
     - Why none of it should be adopted as a package, and where the parts that survive evaluation already live in the backlog (#439, #471, #472).

31. **[55 - SonarAnalyzer removal](./55-SONAR-REMOVAL.md)**
     - Why the Sonar analyzer left (source-available license, AI-use exclusion) and the rule-by-rule map to the
       NetAnalyzers, Meziantou and Roslynator replacements.
     - What each replacement found in `src/` and the emitted code, and which are left below warning (#635).

## ⚡ Quick Summary of Intent

`Parquet.SourceGenerator` is designed to eliminate the reliance on runtime reflection when serializing and deserializing C# domain models (classes, records, structs) to and from Apache Parquet files using `Parquet.Net`. 

By emitting specialized, strongly-typed column readers and writers at compile time, the intended
outcome is:
- **Zero Reflection & Maximum Throughput**: Direct array transfers between C# memory and Parquet columns.
- **Native AOT & Trimming Compatibility**: reflection-free generated code is a precondition for
  AOT and trimming. CI publishes the AOT test project with `-r linux-x64` and runs the resulting
  native binary on every run — `linux-x64` only, and Parquet.Net itself still emits trim and
  AOT-analysis warnings.
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catches schema mismatches and unsupported data types before running code.
