# Parquet.SourceGenerator Documentation Hub

Welcome to the **Parquet.SourceGenerator** documentation repository. This folder contains the architectural specifications, API designs, implementation details, and project roadmap for building a production-grade, high-throughput C# Source Generator for the [Parquet.Net](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet) library.

---

## 📚 Documentation Portal

The documentation is organized into three distinct tiers based on audience and intent:
- **[Guides](#-guides)** — Task-oriented, consumer-facing documentation for adopting and using the generator.
- **[Reference](#-reference)** — Technical specifications, API surface contracts, compiler diagnostics, and compatibility matrices.
- **[Internals & Engineering Spikes](#-internals--engineering-spikes)** — Contributor deep-dives, compiler pipeline architecture, benchmarking machinery, and deterministic quality gates.

11. **[17 - Generated Public API Baselines](./17-GENERATED-API-BASELINES.md)**
     - The `.api.txt` signature-only baseline emitted next to every golden file, and its grammar.
     - Why it borrows the `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` grammar, and the two deliberate deviations.
     - Deterministic ordinal ordering, the `UPDATE_GOLDEN_FILES` refresh path, and the CI gate.

12. **[18 - The API Change Contract](./18-API-CHANGE-CONTRACT.md)**
     - The rule: nothing enters a governed surface without a catalogue line *and* a ledger entry.
     - The three surfaces (emitted / shipped package / internal seams) and their build gates
       `PARQAPI001`, `RS0016` and `PARQAPI002`.
     - Semver buckets, the pre-1.0 stance, the `**Unapproved-by-design:**` escape hatch, and the
       four-step author process.

13. **[19 - Public API Surface & Naming Grammar](./19-PUBLIC-API-SURFACE.md)**
     - The four-axis read grid — source × shape × execution × pushdown — and which cells exist.
     - Eight catalogued surface defects, each checkable against the `*.api.txt` baselines.
     - The options-vs-parameters rule (D1), the naming grammar, and the fate of the flat methods.

14. **[20 - Unified Pushdown & the Generated/Shipped Boundary](./20-UNIFIED-PUSHDOWN-API.md)**
     - One inspectable filter replacing four pushdown mechanisms; capability declared by attribute, not at the call site.
     - What stays generated, what ships, and the measurements that decide it.

15. **[21 - Code Metrics Baselines & The Complexity Ratchet](./21-CODE-METRICS.md)**
     - Checked-in Roslyn metrics baselines under `metrics/`, gated on drift rather than on absolute values.
     - What the Maintainability Index does *not* tell you, and why `CA1502` is calibrated below the
       cited guidance, with the history of its two named exceptions (#263 deleted both).
     - The measured evidence: `CodeEmitter` at 2,536 lines / complexity 144 (a size problem with
       well-decomposed methods), and the former `TargetParser.CollectMembers` at cyclomatic
       complexity 105 — decomposed in #263, worst method now 25.

16. **[22 - Generated Code Metrics](./22-GENERATED-CODE-METRICS.md)**
     - The same mechanism turned on the *emitted* code: a `*.metrics.txt` beside every `*.api.txt`.
     - Which metrics carry signal for generated code and which do not — the Maintainability Index
       is reported but not gated, with the measurement that says why.
     - `ELOC_PER_MEMBER`, the size-per-capability ratio: 10 executable lines per emitted member for
       flat models, 33 for row-level lists.

17. **[23 - Duplication Measurement & The Drift Gate](./23-DUPLICATION.md)**
     - Layer 3 of #251: token-level duplication across `src/`, checked in as `metrics/duplication.txt`
       and gated on drift — the `*.api.txt` grammar again.
     - Calibrated against the repo's demonstrated failure: the tool names the historical
       `ResolveSchemaField` copies and the three read paths that all broke on #196 before it was
       adopted.
     - Emitted code is out of scope by design — generated output repeating itself is the design,
       not a defect.

18. **[24 - The Metrics Oracle](./24-METRICS-ORACLE.md)**
     - Nightly `windows-latest` job running Microsoft's own `Metrics.exe` against the layer-1
       baselines — the independent check on the bespoke computation that gates everything else.
     - Type-level agreement gated (MI ±2, the rest exact); assembly totals reported but never
       gated, because the two tools differ in enumeration scope before they could differ in
       arithmetic.
     - Disagreement opens a GitHub issue rather than leaving a red schedule: failing nightlies
       get muted; issues get acted on.

19. **[25 - The Call Graph](./25-CALL-GRAPH.md)**
     - The #251 family's structural view: connectivity as a gated artifact — drift on a
       checked-in method-level edge list, catalogued cycles, a fan-out ratchet, and a
       layering rule (components must not call the emitter hub) that would have caught the
       `ResolveSchemaField` divergence as it happened.
     - The honest half: what the static approximation cannot see (delegates, virtuals), and
       why the unresolved count is a headline number rather than a footnote.

20. **[26 - Mutation Testing the Behavioural Suite](./26-MUTATION-TESTING.md)**
     - Layer 4 of #251: would a test notice if a line were *wrong*, not just executed? Stryker,
       run nightly. The design is the exclusion — golden-file / API-baseline / metrics / IL-shape
       suites are left out because they kill every mutation trivially and report a flattering lie.
     - Reports through one refreshed PR, never a red build; no threshold until the baseline exists.

21. **[27 - Architectural Peer Study: Protobuf & Serialization Engines](./27-ARCHITECTURAL-PEER-STUDY-PROTOBUF.md)**
     - Comparative analysis of Google.Protobuf, protobuf-net, and Parquet.SourceGenerator.
     - Architectural trade-offs, where PSG leads, peer mechanisms worth stealing (ABI matrix, corpus sweeps, defensive DoS limits), and why runtime engine seams are rejected.

## ⚡ Quick Summary of Intent

`Parquet.SourceGenerator` is designed to eliminate the reliance on runtime reflection when serializing and deserializing C# domain models (classes, records, structs) to and from Apache Parquet files using `Parquet.Net`. 

By emitting specialized, strongly-typed column readers and writers at compile time, the intended
outcome is:
- **Zero Reflection & Maximum Throughput**: Direct array transfers between C# memory and Parquet columns.
- **Native AOT & Trimming Compatibility**: reflection-free generated code is a precondition for
  AOT and trimming. CI publishes the AOT test project with `-r linux-x64` and runs the resulting
  native binary on every run — `linux-x64` only, and Parquet.Net itself still emits trim and
  AOT-analysis warnings.
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catches schema mismatches and unsupported data types before running code.
