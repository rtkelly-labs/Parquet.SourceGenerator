## 🛑 Repository Conventions & Workflow Policy

1. **Squash Merge Only**: All pull requests must be merged into `main` using **Squash and Merge** exclusively.
2. **Delete Branch on Merge**: Feature branches must be automatically deleted immediately upon merge into `main`.
3. **Linear History**: Maintain a strictly linear history. Rebase feature branches onto `main` before merging.
4. **Direct Push Protection**: Direct pushes to `main` are blocked; PR mechanism required.
5. **Local Temp & Worktree Directory**: All temporary files, databases, and worktrees go in `/temp/` (gitignored).
6. **Gitignored Local TODO File**: A root `TODO.md` file MUST exist for local task tracking and be gitignored.
7. **Auto-Merge Enabled**: PRs may enable auto-merge (squash) so they merge automatically once required checks pass.
8. **Pinned Action SHAs**: All GitHub Actions workflows MUST use 40-character commit SHAs instead of mutable tags.
9. **Tool Restoration via Manifest**: All CLI diagnostic, formatting, and analysis tools are tracked in `.config/dotnet-tools.json` (`csharpier`, `ilspycmd`, `dotnet-inspect`, `dotnet-dump`). Always restore local tools using:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore --disable-parallel
   ```
   *(Or `~/.dotnet/dotnet tool restore --disable-parallel` when targeting local .NET 10 preview runtimes).*
   The `--disable-parallel` flag is strictly required to prevent package extraction race conditions between CLI tools sharing package name prefixes.
10. **Diagnostics Invocation**: Always execute installed tools via `dotnet tool run <command>` (e.g. `dotnet tool run ilspycmd`, `dotnet tool run dotnet-inspect`, `dotnet tool run dotnet-dump`) or via dedicated repository runners (`scripts/InterrogateIL.cs`, `scripts/TriageMemoryDump.cs`).

11. **API Change Contract**: Two API surfaces are governed by catalogues — the shipped package API
    (`PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt`, gated by `RS0016`) and internal seams (`src/api/seams.txt`, gated
    by `PARQAPI002`). Nothing enters either without **both** a catalogue line and a
    `docs/api/LEDGER.md` entry recording its semver bucket. Both gates are **build errors**, not
    test failures. The emitted consumer API is not checked in: CI derives each golden model's
    `.g.cs` and `.api.txt` from the emitter and posts their diff against the merge base as a sticky
    PR comment (`derived` job, `scripts/DerivedOutputs.cs`) — review that section. A ledger entry
    marked `**Unapproved-by-design:**` suppresses the build error for spikes and cannot merge to
    `main`. Full rule: `docs/18-API-CHANGE-CONTRACT.md`.

12. **Upstream Dependency Limitations**: Track package limitations and candidate upstream improvements in `UPSTREAM_DEPENDENCY_LIMITATIONS.md`, not in this file.

13. **Derived outputs are not committed**: emitted golden source and API, code metrics,
    duplication and call-graph edges are generated from the code (`dotnet run
    scripts/DerivedOutputs.cs`, output in gitignored `artifacts/`) and published by CI as the
    `derived-outputs` artifact. Never commit them.

14. **Emitted-code analyzer gate**: every analyzer `src/` runs also runs over the golden models'
    emitted source (`analysis/`, CI job `generated-analysis`, aggregated by the required `build`
    check). Any finding fails it and the baseline (`analysis/GeneratedCodeBaseline.props`) is empty.
    Fix the emitter; never add a baseline entry, `NoWarn` or an `.editorconfig` downgrade. Run it
    locally with `dotnet run scripts/GeneratedCodeAnalysis.cs` after publishing the golden outputs.
    Full rule: `docs/50-GENERATED-CODE-ANALYSIS.md`.

15. **CI gate matrix**: `docs/51-CI-GATE-MATRIX.md` records what each gate protects, where it
    runs and whether a required check reaches it. A new CI job in `ci.yml` must be added to the
    `build` aggregate's `needs` and result check (`CiGateIntegrityTests` fails otherwise), and a
    new gate needs a positive control or an "examined N" assertion so it cannot pass on nothing.
